It develops natural deduction proof systems and models for classical and intuitionistic logic, S4 and S5 modal logics, and classical first-order logics. Models for intuitionistic logic, some three-valued loigcs, two-dimensional logics of actuality, and quantiifed modal logic are discussed. The details of important meta-theoretic results are presented, including Normalization for intuitionistic logic as well as Soundness and Completness for many logics. Each chapter includes many excercises, divided into basic and advanced, to provide practice for the interested student.

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: A challenge for relevant logicians is to delimit their area of study. I propose and explore the definition of a relevant logic as a logic satisfying a variable-sharing property and closed under detachment and adjunction. This definition is, I argue, a good definition that captures many familiar logics and raises interesting new questions concerning relevant logics.

									<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: The universal conception of necessity says that necessary truth is truth in all possi- ble worlds. This idea is well studied in the context of classical possible worlds models, and there its logic is S5. The universal conception of necessity is less well studied in models for non-classical logics. We will present some preliminary results on univer- sal necessity on models for intuitionistic logic, first-degree entailment, and relevant logics. We will close by discussing a way in which universal necessity is a very classical concept.

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: In this paper, I will present two approaches to epistemic logic in the setting of relevant logics. One uses the framework of equivalence classes representing indistinguishability, found in much work in epistemic logics. The other, does not use equivalence classes, but is more common in the area of relevant logics. I will argue that the former has many advantages over the latter while avoiding some of the standard criticisms leveled against the use of equivalence relations in classically-based epistemic logic.

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: Relevant logics are a family of non‐classical logics characterized by the behavior of their implication connectives. Unlike some other non‐classical logics, such as intuitionistic logic, there are multiple philosophical views motivating relevant logics. Further, different views seem to motivate different logics. In this article, we survey five major views motivating the adoption of relevant logics: Use Criterion, sufficiency, meaning containment, theory construction, and truthmaking. We highlight the philosophical differences as well as the different logics they support. We end with some questions for future research.

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: Justification logics provide frameworks for studying the fine structure of evidence and justification. Traditionally, these logics do not impose any closure requirements on justification. In this paper, we argue that for some applications they should subject justification to closure under some variety of logical consequence. Specifically, we argue, building on ideas from Beall, that the non-classical logic FDE offers a particularly attractive notion of consequence for this purpose and define a justification logic where justification is closed under FDE consequence. We show the resulting logic to be sound and complete. Lastly, we discuss how the closure of justification under FDE contrasts closure under related non-classical logics and how our approach contrasts with some alternatives.

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: This paper will develop ideas from Savi&cacute; and Studer.  We will generalize their work in two directions. First, we provide axioms for justification logics over the base logic B and show that the logic permits a proof of the internalization theorem. Second, we provide alternative frames that more closely resemble the standard versions of the ternary relational frames, as well as a more general approach to the completeness proof. We prove that soundness and completeness hold for justification logics over a wide variety of base logics. Finally, we will strengthen Belnap's variable sharing property for the justification logic context, demonstrating that the justifications are properly relevant justifications.

									<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: In this paper, we build on earlier work by Standefer in investigating extensions of substructural logics, particularly relevant logics, with the machinery of justification logics. We strengthen a negative result from the earlier work showing a limitation with the canonical model method of proving completeness. We then show how to enrich the language with an additional operator for implicit commitment to circumvent these problems. We then extend the logics with axioms for D, 4, and 5, which requires additional justification term operators, following the work of Pacuit and Rubtsova, and present the required modifications to the frame semantics. We present a simplification of the neighborhood frames from the earlier work and we close by investigating the distinctive contribution of the + operator to the logic.

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: We present a new frame semantics for positive relevant and substructural propositional logics. This frame semantics is both a <i>generalisation</i> of Routley-Meyer ternary frames and a <i>simplification</i> of them. The key innovation of this semantics is the use of a single accessibility relation to relate <i>collections</i> of points to points. Different logics are modeled by varying the kinds of collections used: they can be sets, multisets, lists or trees.  We show that collection frames on trees are sound and complete for the basic positive distributive substructural logic B, that collection frames on multisets are sound and complete for RW (the relevant logic R, without contraction, or equivalently, positive multiplicative and additive linear logic with distribution for the additive connectives), and that collection frames on sets are sound for the positive relevant logic R. The completeness of set frames for R is, currently, an open question.

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: In classically based modal logic, there are three common conceptions of necessity, the universal conception, the equivalence relation conception, and the axiomatic conception. They provide distinct presentations of the modal logic S5, all of which coincide in the basic modal language. We explore these different conceptions in the context of the relevant logic R, demonstrating where they come apart. This reveals that there are many options for being an S5-ish extension of R. It further reveals a divide between the universal conception of necessity on the one hand, and the axiomatic conception on the other: The latter is consistent with motivations for rel- evant logics while the former is not. For the committed relevant logician, necessity cannot be the truth in all possible worlds.

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: There appears to be few, if any, limits on what sorts of logical connectives can be added to a given logic. One source of potential limitations is the motivating ideology associated with a logic. While extraneous to the logic, the motivating ideology is often important for the development of formal and philosophical work on that logic, as is the case with intuitionistic logic. One family of logics for which the philosophical ideology is important is the family of relevant logics. In this paper, I explore the limits of what a relevant connective is, showing how some basic crite- ria motivated by the ideology of relevant logicians provide robust limits on potential connectives. These criteria provide some plausible necessary conditions on being a relevant connective.

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: In relevant logics, necessary truths need not imply each other. In justification logic, necessary truths need not all be justified by the same reason. There is an affinity to these two approaches that suggest their pairing will provide good logics for tracking reasons in a fine-grained way. In this paper, I will show how to extend relevant logics with some of the basic operators of justification logic in order to track justifications, or reasons. I will define and study three kinds of frames for these logics. For the first kind of frame, I show soundness and highlight a difficulty in proving completeness. This motivates the two alternative kinds of frames, with respect to which completeness results are obtained. Axioms to strengthen the justification logic portions of these logics are considered. I close by developing an analogy between the dot operator of justification logic and theory fusion in relevant logics.

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: Anderson and Belnap [1975] presented a Fitch natural deduction system, FE, for their logic E of entailment as well as Fitch systems for the relevant logics T and R. The system FE is obtained from the system for R through a restriction on the rule of reiteration. Brady [1984] presents Fitch systems for a range of relevant logics, none of which uses a restriction on the rule of reiteration. However, no Fitch system for E was presented. We fill this lacuna by providing two Fitch systems for E, neither of which uses a restriction on the rule of reiteration. We close by discussing their differences and possible connections to other extant systems for E.

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: We present some proof-theoretic results for the normal modal logic whose characteristic axiom is &#9633;~A&equiv;~&#9633;A. We present a sequent system for this logic and a hypersequent system for its first-order form and show that these are equivalent to Hilbert-style axiomatizations. We show that the question of validity for these logics reduces to that of classical tautologyhood and first-order logical truth, respectively.

							<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: We offer a defense of one aspect of Paul Horwich's response to the Liar paradox---more specifically, of his move to preserve classical logic. Horwich's response requires that the full intersubstitutivity of ` `A' is true' and A be abandoned. It is thus open to the objection, due to Hartry Field, that it undermines the generalization function of truth. We defend Horwich's move by isolating the grade of intersubstitutivity required by the generalization function and by providing a new reading of the biconditionals of the form `` `A' is true iff A.''

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: This paper has two aims. First, it sets out an interpretation of the relevant logic E of relevant entailment based on the theory of situated inference. Second, it uses this interpretation, together with Anderson and Belnap’s natural deduction system for E, to generalise E to a range of other systems of strict relevant implication. Routley-Meyer ternary relation semantics for these systems are produced and completeness theorems are proven.

I present systems of circular definitions in the Strong Kleene and supervaluation schemes and provide complete proof systems for them. One class of definitions, the intrinsic definitions, naturally arises in both schemes. I survey some of the features of this class of definitions.

We show that revision theory, when enriched with the new conditionals, yields an attractive theory of truth. We go on to compare this theory with one recently proposed by Hartry Field.

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: An important question for proponents of non-contractive approaches to paradox is why contraction fails. One non-contractive theorist, Elia Zardini, offers the answer that the paradoxical sentences exhibit a kind of instability. I elaborate this idea using revision theory, and I argue that while instability does motivate failures of contraction, it equally motivates failure of many principles that non-contractive theorists want to maintain.

								<div id="hidden"><br>Abstract: In <i>Saving Truth from Paradox</i>, Hartry Field presents and defends a theory of truth with a new conditional. In this paper, I present two criticisms of this theory, one concerning its assessments of validity and one concerning its treatment of truth-preservation claims. One way of adjusting the theory adequately responds to the truth-preservation criticism, at the cost of making the validity criticism worse. I show that in a restricted setting, Field has a way to respond to the validity criticism. I close with some general considerations on the use of revision-theoretic methods in theories of truth.

								The logic of the box gives rise to a simple modal logic, and we relate provability in the extended proof system to this modal logic via a completeness theorem, using interpretations over circular definitions, analogous to Solovay's completeness theorem for <i>GL</i> using arithmetical interpretations. We adapt our proof to a special class of circular definitions as well as to the first-order case.

We then show that relevant logics are hyperintensional in this sense, drawing consequences for other non-classical logics, including HYPE and some substructural logics. We further prove results concerning extensionality in relevant logics. We close by discussing related concepts for classifying formula contexts and potential applications of these results.
